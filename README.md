# 🌐 React Router Project - GitHub Profile & Navigation

A simple **React project** built with **Vite**, **React Router**, and **Tailwind CSS**.  
It allows smooth navigation between multiple pages — **Home, About, Contact, and GitHub**.  
In the **GitHub section**, I fetch data from the **GitHub API** to display my profile picture 👤 and followers 👥 in real-time.
